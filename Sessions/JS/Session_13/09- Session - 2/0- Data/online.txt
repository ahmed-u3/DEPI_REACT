3- If the randomly chosen number matches the target number, print "Winner".
4- If the randomly chosen number does not match the target number, print "Try again".



let str = "racecar";
===> Problem: Palindrome Check
Description:
1- Given a variable str containing a string, check if the string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

let substring = "longer";
===> Problem: Check for Substring Presence
Description:
Given a variable fullString containing a string and a variable substring containing a substring, check if the substring is present in the fullString.
Use if statements to determine if fullString contains substring.
Print a message indicating whether the substring is found within the full string or not.
